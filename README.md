# Netflix_Movies
My project will be the Netflix movies and TV Show dataset, Netflix is an application that keeps growing exponentially whole around the world and it is the most famous streaming platform. It given a large number of movies and series available on the platform, it is a perfect opportunity to flex our data manipulation skills and dive into the entertainment industry.
   The goal of this project was to Recommends content based on movie description. Here I would recommend Movie based on Movie titles only. Similar movies would have similar names thus having a high cosine similarity. Then the movies that are most likely to be similar are recommended.
    I generates TF-IDF matrix and finds cosine similarity of each movie with other movies and displays top 10 similar movies, and to analysis and visualization of content is available in different countries, analysis of Actors / Directors and find interesting insights.
